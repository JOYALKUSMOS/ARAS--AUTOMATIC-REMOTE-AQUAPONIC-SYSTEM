# PLANT-E

## Documentation
PLANT-E is an IOT cloud-based remote plant monitoring system that makes it possible to produce sustainably and economically at all hours and in all seasons. It is an RTC system with a synchronized clock for service routines and sensors like BMP, peltier, and temperature to measure the soil's moisture, temperature, and humidity as well as the atmosphere's overall humidity. The system can then be adjusted by changing the fans or adding irrigation to maintain a constant equilibrium for the plan to grow optimally. A business plan, a roadmap, a cost analysis, and an advantage are all available. The IOT APP that we've put in place controls the cloud. This project was implemented on two hackathon competetion and has won 1st prize(IEEE Eve Hack 2023) Credits to Nidhin Chandran and adil ansari and 3rd prize(VEGATHON 2022) credits to Nidhin Chandran,Nandu Kannan and Adarsh K

### Circuit
Arduino uno and nodemcu esp8266 is the core of the system.Parameters such as temperature,humidity,pressure etc are measured by DHT11 and BMP180 module and the real time features of the system is implemented using and RTC ds3231 module which acts as the real time clock enabling features such as light source for photosynthesis for plants and the timely circulation of water in the system.All the output devices are triggered by relay module.All the datas can be monitored using our handheld devices using blynk iot
